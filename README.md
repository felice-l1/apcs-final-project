My project aims to create photomosaics with emojis. Photomosaics are images made up of other tiny images. For example, in the image below, the overall image, the Mona Lisa, is made up of many tiny images of other works of art. My project would receive a file from the user, then process it to create a photomosaic. In my case, the tiny images would be emojis.
